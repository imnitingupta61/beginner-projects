# begibber-projects

This repository contains beginner-level Python and machine learning projects created during my early learning phase.

## What’s Inside:
- Classification model practice
- Data preprocessing & cleaning exercises

⚠️ These projects were written by me during self-practice. Some are incomplete or for experimentation.

## Current Focus 🎯
I’m currently preparing for Data/Tech roles and focusing on SQL and backend skills.  
Stay tuned for my updated work here and on my new repository!
